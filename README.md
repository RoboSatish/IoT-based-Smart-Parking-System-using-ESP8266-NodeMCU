# IoT-based-Smart-Parking-System-using-ESP8266-NodeMCU

With growing popularity of Smart Cities, there is always a demand for smart solutions for every domain. The IoT has enabled the possibility of Smart Cities with itâ€™s over the internet control feature. A person can control the devices installed in his home or office from anywhere in the world by just using a smartphone or any internet connected devices. There are multiple domains in a smart city and Smart Parking is one of the popular domain in the Smart City.
The Smart Parking industry has seen a number of innovations such Smart Parking Management System, Smart Gate Control, Smart Cameras which can detect types of vehicle, ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition), Smart Payment System, Smart Entry System and many more. Today similar approach will be followed and a smart parking solution will be built which will use an ultrasonic sensor to detect vehicle presence and trigger the gate to open or close automatically. The ESP8266 NodeMCU will be used here as the main controller to control all the peripherals attached to it.
